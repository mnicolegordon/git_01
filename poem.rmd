Children three that nestle near,  
Eager eye and willing ear,

When Miep took us home with her  
She held us up in the air,  
  
Eye-level with those eyes  
You may know, eyes spelling  
  
Sorrow-girl, wait-for-me,  
Happiness-around-a-corner-  
  
One-day, hurry-back, don’t-tell.  
Two new hands took us in,  
  
Skin cradling skin.  
How empty we had been,  
  
Only a little bit worn —  
Not a penny, not a pebble  
  
Dwelling within.  
We became an altar,
